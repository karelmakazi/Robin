  {descId:1,
    descName:"Stance",
    descCont:'Start by facing the target at about 45 degrees, feet spread about shoulder-width apart. Your toes should be pointing well towards the target. This stance allows a clear view of your target as well as moving the string away from your bow arm - reducing the chance of a string strike interfering with your accuracy.'},
  {descId:2,
    descName:"Bow Grip",
    descCont:'Grip your bow with a relaxed, closed hand. A tight, white-knuckle grip will tense your entire bow arm and severely degrade accuracy. Most top bow shots lightly touch their thumb to forefinger or middle finger in front of the grip. If you cannot seem to master a loose grip, try an open bow hand with a wrist sling.'},
  {descId:3,
    descName:"Draw",
    descCont:" The most common finger grip on the string is index finger above the arrow nock and next two fingers below the arrow nock. Extend the bow fully and smoothly draw the string straight back to your face, without pushing the bow forward or dipping or raising the bow. "},
  {descId:4,
    descName:"Anchor",
    descCont:"Once the bowstring is drawn, lock your string hand against the side of your face. Find a comfortable anchor point that aligns your aiming eye with the string. A common anchor for finger shooters is pressing the index finger in the corner of the mouth, with the thumb dropped beneath the chin."},
  {descId:5,
    descName:"Aim",
    descCont:"At full draw, find your target, use your dominant eye to focus on the target, and orient the bow so that when you look through the bow sight, the pin meets the target in your line of sight. Move the bow smoothly, hold solidly on target for a second or two, and release the arrow."},
  {descId:6,
    descName:"Release",
    descCont:"The string release must be smooth, without a jerk or flinch. Simply relax all your fingers after you aim. The bowstring will do the rest, ripping away with the arrow. Itâ€™s easier to release with a tab on your fingers instead of a glove, because a glove develops grooves and hangs up a smooth release."},
  {descId:7,
    descName:"Follow Through",
    descCont:"After you release, keep aiming until the arrow actually hits the target. Hold your bow up and try to keep the sight picture the same. Your string hand will slide backward along your face and the bow will recoil to one side. But if you try to continue the aim, your accuracy will be superior."},
  {descId:8,
    descName:"Focus Intro",
    descCont:"Please select an area you want to focus on in your archery practice. After selecting an area you can add additional notes outlining what you will be working on. Lastly you need to specify a duration for your practice."}
